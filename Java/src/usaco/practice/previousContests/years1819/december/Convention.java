/*
 * Farmer John is hosting a new bovine grass-eating convention at his farm!
 *
 * Cows from all over the world are arriving at the local airport to attend the convention and eat grass. Specifically,
 * there are N cows arriving at the airport (1≤N≤105) and cow i arrives at time ti (0≤ti≤109). Farmer John has arranged M (1≤M≤105)
 * buses to transport the cows from the airport. Each bus can hold up to C cows in it (1≤C≤N). Farmer John is waiting with the buses
 * at the airport and would like to assign the arriving cows to the buses. A bus can leave at the time when the last cow on it arrives.
 * Farmer John wants to be a good host and so does not want to keep the arriving cows waiting at the airport too long. What is the smallest
 * possible value of the maximum waiting time of any one arriving cow if Farmer John coordinates his buses optimally? A cow’s waiting time
 * is the difference between her arrival time and the departure of her assigned bus.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that MC≥N.
