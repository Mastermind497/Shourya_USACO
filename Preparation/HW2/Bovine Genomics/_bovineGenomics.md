# Bovine Genomics

## US Open 2017

### Gold

#### Problem 1

For this problem, I used Brute Force to get 7 / 10 with C++ and 8 / 10 with Java. To brute force, I found every combination of strings (shorter than the current minimum) and added them to a set. Then I took the same substring from all the of the plain cows and checked if they existed in the set. It did quite well for a Brute Force in gold.

Here is my C++ Solution (7 / 10):

@import "bovineGenomics.cpp"

Here is my Java Solution (8 / 10):

@import "BovineGenomics.java"
