#### Problem 1

For this problem, all you need is a Brute Force algorithm with Hashing, which will run in time. Hashing will reduce the time for comparisons, and therefore reduce the time limit for finding if an substring is already present.

Here is my C++ Solution (7 / 10):

@import "bovineGenomics.cpp"
